## **Project Description**
Project-Based Internship is one of Rakamin Academy's programs that helps people increase their skills, portfolio, and work experience by joining a virtual internship with a wide variety choice of well-known companies. From this program, I joined the Big Data Analytics internship at Kimia Farma. Kimia Farma is the first pharmaceutical producer and distributor in Indonesia that was founded by the Dutch East Indies Government in 1817. As a Big Data Analytics Intern, my final task is to evaluate Kimia Farma business performance from 2020 until 2023 by making an analysis dashboard for a more deeper understanding of data and it's analysis.

## **01: Data Preparation with Google BigQuery**
Here are the steps that I've done to prepare the data and make data mart before designing the dashboard and making the analysis:
1. Download the csv datasets that were given as an analysis materials.
2. Open Google BigQuery and make a new project called "Rakamin-KF-Analytics"
3. Create new datasets called "kimia_farma" and import the csv datasets that were given into it.
4. Create the data marts by combining the necessary information from the csv datasets.
