## **Project Description**
Project-Based Internship is one of Rakamin Academy's programs that helps people increase their skills, portfolio, and work experience by joining a virtual internship with a wide variety choice of well-known companies. From this program, I joined the Big Data Analytics internship at Kimia Farma. Kimia Farma is the first pharmaceutical producer and distributor in Indonesia that was founded by the Dutch East Indies Government in 1817. As a Big Data Analytics Intern, my final task is to evaluate Kimia Farma business performance from 2020 until 2023 by making an analysis dashboard for a more deeper understanding of data and it's analysis.

## **01: Data Preparation with Google BigQuery**
Here are the steps that I've done to prepare the data and make data mart before designing the dashboard and making the analysis:
1. Download the csv datasets that were given as an analysis materials.

**kf_final_transaction.csv**
  - transaction_id: kode id transaksi
  - product_id : kode produk obat
  - branch_id: kode id cabang Kimia Farma
  - customer_name: nama customer yang melakukan transaksi
  - date: tanggal transaksi dilakukan
  - price: harga obat
  - discount_percentage: Persentase diskon yang diberikan pada obat
  - rating: penilaian konsumen terhadap transaksi yang dilakukan

**kf_product.csv**
  - product_id: kode produk obat
  - product_name: nama produk obat
  - product_category: kategori produk obat
  - price: harga obat

**kf_inventory.csv**
  - inventory_ID: kode inventory produk obat
  - branch_id: kode id cabang Kimia Farma
  - product_id: kode id produk obat
  - product_name: nama produk obat
  - opname_stock: jumlah stok produk obat

**kf_kantor_cabang.csv**
  - branch_id: kode id cabang Kimia Farma
  - branch_category: kategori cabang Kimia Farma
  - branch_name: nama kantor cabang Kimia Farma
  - kota: kota cabang Kimia Farma
  - provinsi: provinsi cabang Kimia Farma
  - rating: penilaian konsumen terhadap cabang Kimia Farma
  
2. Open Google BigQuery and make a new project called "Rakamin-KF-Analytics"
3. Create new datasets called "kimia_farma" and import the csv datasets that were given into it.
4. Create the data marts by combining the necessary information from the csv datasets.

## **02: Dashboard Analysis Design**
After the data preparation, I designed the dashboard for business performance analysis by using Google Looker Studio. Here is the link for the interactive dashboard : [Interactive Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/rCDlWcqjypc).

**Based on the analysis that was carried out by using the dashboard, these are the insights that I've concluded:**
1. Kimia Farma experienced an increment in their yearly profit, here are the percentages for the increase :
   - 2020 to 2021 = 99%
   - 2021 to 2022 = 50%
   - 2022 to 2023 = 33%
3. The best branch from Kimia Farma is located in Jawa Barat, this conclusion is based on that branch having the highest nett sales and being in the top 5 of the highest branch rating.
4. The most popular products from Kimia Farma are Psycholeptics drugs, Hypnotics, and sedative drugs which are mostly used for calming effects. One of the reasons may be because of the phenomenon of increasing mental health problems in Indonesia starting from 2020 until now. [Source](https://www.kompas.id/baca/humaniora/2023/05/03/krisis-kesehatan-mental-melonjak-di-kalangan-remaja).

**From those conclusions, here are a few suggestions to increase the business performance:**
1. Since the branches in Jawa Barat have a good record of sales and ratings, Kimia Farma should analyze the facilities and services in those branches to apply them to other branches as well. This might help other branches to be as good as the one in Jawa Barat which also can increase the overall performance of Kimia Farma. Apart from the facilities and services, the products that are needed in the area must also be taken into consideration because each region may have different needs so the promoted product will also be different.
2. Create a marketing strategy to start a mental health awareness campaign that focuses on its phenomenon in Indonesia and how to face it, highlighting the danger of misusing drugs to calm oneself and the dependency on using them. According to the news, younger generations tend to diagnose themselves as having mental health problems without professional help and carelessly buying drugs. Those problems can be taken into consideration in educating the people by using the campaign. Kimia Farma can also collaborate with other medical industries to help people get the proper help for their mental health problems and provide the right drugs. This campaign cannot only bring more customers but also increase Kimia Farma's brand image, especially from younger generations that take serious consideration on mental health.
